# nasa-goldmansachs
This repo is created as submission of iOS Assignment for Goldman Sachs.

# Steps to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the project file.
3. Run the app

# Functionality
1. This Application will be able to fetch the APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) from a public API provided by NASA.
2. The user will be able to get the latest Picture of the day or specify a date to get the picture of that date.
3. The user will be able to add any picture as a favourite and they'll appear in a separate section called "Favourites" inside the app
4. Once an image is viewed, it'll be saved to the device. Because of this, no internet is required to see the image of a date that is already opened once.
5. All favourites don't need internet connection to see them.
6. This app supports all orientations and all devices.

# Assumptions
1. It is assumed that NASA will not change any data of a date once uploaded. For this reason, API will not be called for the dates that are already viewed.

# Frameworks Used
1. SwiftUI
2. CoreData
